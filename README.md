In this manual you wil learn how to make your own server wich is connected with the Spotify API to retrieve data about the currently played track, the collected data will consist of the album cover, the BPM (beats per minute) of the currently played song. Also this manual will show you how to connect with the Vibrant API to collect the most prominent colours from the album cover. At last this manual will show you how to use this data in an arduino code to make your LED Light blink in the correct timing with the colours from the Album cover.
